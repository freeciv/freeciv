"much you prefer one kind of production to another; setting science to 3 "
"means you prefer a single bulb to three shields (or gold, trade,...). You "
"can set different factors for each kind of production, according to your "
"needs.\n"
"\n"
"If you set up some Minimal Surpluses which are impossible to fulfill, the "

"the ongoing game, it passes back control to you. So you'd better not define "
"too high a surplus; instead, use factors to achieve your goals.\n"
"\n"
"The Celebrate checkbox lets your city - celebrate. This will work only with "
"a high luxury rate. See help about 'Happiness'.\n"
"\n"
"Clicking on 'Control city' puts the city under control of the governor, "
"'Release city' passes control back to you.\n"
"\n"
"For ease of use, you can save your slider setting as a preset with a name. "
"Click on 'add preset' and enter a name for your setting. You can use this "
"preset in every city by just clicking on its name. Also, you can control "
"your setting from within the city report, in the governor column. And you "
"can change it from there (use 'change' --> 'Citizen Governor'), if you have "
"saved it as a preset.\n"
"\n"
"Use 'Game' --> 'Save Settings' to store your presets permanently.\n"

"But beware! If you use the governor for some of your cities, you will "
