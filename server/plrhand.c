  Embassies:  All embassies with other players are lost.  Other players
              retain their embassies with pplayer.
   * Units:      Units inside cities are assigned to the new owner
              of the city.  Units outside are transferred along
              with the ownership of their supporting city.
              If the units are in a unit stack with non rebel units,

              are teleported to that city.  If the stack is a
              transport at sea, then all rebel units on the
              transport are teleported to their nearest allied city.

  Cities:     Are split randomly into 2.  This results in a real

  One caveat, since the spliting of cities is random, you can
  conceive that this could result in either the original player

  ensures that each side gets roughly half, which ones is still
  determined randomly.
