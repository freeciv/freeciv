"The Inca were an Amerind people of the Northern Andes who conquered an "

"southern Chile nearly to the Equator. They had the bad timing to do it just "
"a few decades before the Spanish conquistadors arrived in their part of the "
"world in the 1530s CE. In that short time frame, the Inca were able to build "
"over 15,000 km of roads throughout their realm. Their state was the largest "
"in the Americas prior to the Spanish conquest and was maintained through a "
"complex, hierarchical and pragmatic administrative system. They were, "
"however, wracked as many kingdoms have been by crises of succession. When "
"the Spanish arrived, the Inca were in the middle of one such crisis - the "
"war between Atawallpa and Waskhar. They were the sons of the late ruler "
"Wayna Qhapaq, who had died from disease - likely smallpox - that was "
"sweeping through the land."
