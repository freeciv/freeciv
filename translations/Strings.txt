This file contains strings that should be translated, but
are for some reason not available to be collected from any source
files. They are collected from this file instead.

Version tags

These are sent by metaserver

While the follow tag compared to one received from the metaserver
does not contain qualifiers, we do pass string with the qualifier
added to gettext to get the translation.
/* TRANS: Version tag name received from metaserver */
_("?vertag:stable")
_("?vertag:windows")
_("?vertag:S3_0")
_("?vertag:S3_1")
_("?vertag:crosser")
_("?vertag:windows-S3_0")
_("?vertag:windows-S3_1")

/* TRANS: part of revision based version number string
          "(modified 855bfb8e2f)" (the second 'word' is a git hash)
          (Preserve the trailing space.) */
_("modified ")
