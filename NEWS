The most important changes between major releases are shown below.
Not all changes are shown here. To see detailed changes in the 2.4
series, check NEWS-2.4. Those who are interested in seeing more
detailed changes should check the ChangeLog file.


MAJOR CHANGES FROM 2.3.x to 2.4.0
---------------------------------

   (from <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-2.4.0>)

   As is usual for major releases, 2.4 clients cannot interoperate with
   pre-2.4 servers, and vice versa. Pre-2.4 savegames can however be
   loaded into 2.4, and in most cases, the supplied rulesets have not
   changed so much as to make it difficult to complete a game started with
   2.3.x's rules.

Server / General

Gameplay

     * The maximum theoretical map size has increased from 128,000 to
       2,048,000 tiles; the maximum linear map dimension has increased
       from 512 to 32,768. GNA#18087
     * If map generation fails (for instance the common failure to
       allocate start positions), it is now retried with a different
       random seed. GNAPATCH#2402
     * A couple of new server settings have been added to customise
       gameplay:
          + 'revealmap' allows the map to be shown to all players at game
            start, or to dead players. GNAPATCH#2379
          + 'first_timeout' allows the first turn to have a different
            timeout from subsequent turns. GNAPATCH#1967

Clerical

     * Player authentication has been revamped. Database access is now
       mediated by a Lua script that can be customised by server
       operators, and uses Luasql, enabling a variety of backends: MySQL
       (the only backend supported previously), SQLite, and PostgreSQL.
       See doc/README.fcdb for details. GNA#13643
          + Support is included 'out of the box' for SQLite and MySQL
            databases. SQLite uses a simple file as a database, and is
            recommended as being entirely adequate for Freeciv
            authentication and much less hassle to set up than MySQL.
          + The Windows packages include SQLite support, so for the first
            time, it's possible to use player authentication on Windows
            without building the server yourself.
     * The server now supports a 'delegation' feature similar to that in
       Longturn, where one user can nominate another to temporarily take
       over control of the game. This is controlled by the '/delegate'
       server command. GNAPATCH#2121
     * There is a new "map image" feature to save an overview map as an
       image. This is a much expanded version of the previous --Ppm server
       feature, which has been removed. Compared to --Ppm, the new feature
       can distinguish units, cities, borders, terrain colors, hex tiles,
       and more. Saving images can be triggered automatically (turn-based)
       on the server, or on demand on the server or client. See the
       '/mapimg' server command. GNAPATCH#1391
          + A series of these images can be assembled into an animation to
            replay the progress of the game. A shell script 'mapimg2anim'
            is provided to help with this.
          + PNG/GIF/JPEG output is only available if built against the
            ImageMagick library. The Windows 2.4.0-beta1 packages only
            support the basic PPM format.
     * Player colors are now assigned centrally, and can be changed with
       the '/playercolor' server command. There is a new server setting
       'plrcolormode' that controls how colors are assigned, including a
       mode where all players on a team have the same color. GNAPATCH#2062
          + The set of default player colors in the supplied rulesets has
            been reworked to enhance visibility of borders against
            terrain, etc. GNA#19778
     * The colors used to represent different terrain types on the minimap
       have been reworked. GNAPATCH#2069
     * The 'autosaves' setting gives finer control over when savegames are
       generated. GNAPATCH#2536
          + To disable autosaves entirely, instead of '/set saveturns 0',
            it's now necessary to use a command like '/set autosaves ""'.
     * The scripts 'ser' and 'civ' have been renamed to 'fcser' and
       'fcgui' respectively. GNAPATCH#2830
     * A Lua script can be read from a file with the '/lua file' command.
       Direct Lua input is now via the '/lua cmd' command. GNAPATCH#2338
       GNAPATCH#2869
     * New server option --Bind-meta to control which network interface
       the metaserver connection is made from. GNA#14106
     * The server can be built with support for .xz (LZMA) compression for
       saved games, etc. See the 'compresstype' option. GNAPATCH#1810
     * The freeciv-modpack utility supports more modpack types, more
       options (see --help), and uses the Curl library for network access
       so should be more robust.
     * (as of beta2) The ranklog format has changed; it now includes
       individual players' scores, and can be parsed more unambiguously.
       GNAPATCH#3346

Clients

     * There is a new client, freeciv-gtk3, based on version 3 of the Gtk+
       toolkit. This is fully playable and has largely identical UI and
       functionality to freeciv-gtk2. Currently it is experimental;
       however, it is expected that it will become the default client in
       the next major release.
          + The first time you run this client, it will copy any Gtk2
            client settings you have set. Thereafter, Gtk2 and Gtk3
            settings will remain separate.
          + Known issue: when compiled against some versions of Gtk3,
            there are assertion failures and crashes associated with the
            unit selection dialog. This is believed due to a Gtk bug
            (671939). GNA#19846
     * (In the code there is also the start of a Qt client. However, at
       this point it is just a stub and is unlikely to be of interest.
       Development will continue in 2.5.)
     * A server spawned by the client now only listens on the local
       network interface, so clients on other machines cannot connect to
       it. This improves security for single-player games, but means that
       a multiplayer game can no longer be hosted by the client; you must
       start a separate server instead (see the FAQ). GNA#18530
     * It's now possible to display a map overlay indicating which tiles
       the currently selected unit can enter ("native" tiles), with the
       Shift-Ctrl-N keyboard shortcut. GNA#13620
     * The research speed in bulbs per turn is now available with other
       research information from popups/tooltips on the main window.
       GNA#17685 GNA#16481
     * For rulesets where different nations have unique gameplay
       attributes (different initial governments, techs, units, or
       buildings), this information is now available when picking a nation
       in the pregame, and in the online help. GNAPATCH#3066
     * The client now displays the current stable version of Freeciv and
       whether that's newer than the running version (this information
       comes from the metaserver). GNAPATCH#2735
     * (Gtk) The client now has a Lua scripting console. GNAPATCH#2515
          + This is currently something of a proof of concept rather than
            a finished feature, as a comprehensive API suitable for the
            client-side has not been provided. Notably, there are not yet
            any signals from which client-side scripts can be triggered.
          + However, client scripts do have access to the client's view of
            most of the same game data that server-side ruleset scripts do
            (map, units, cities etc); see the Lua reference manual. This
            should be sufficient for some useful work. For example, it
            should in principle be possible to implement an on-demand
            optimal trade route calculator with these facilities (although
            we haven't tried).
     * (Gtk) The unit selection dialog has been revamped to allow browsing
       and selecting units by combinations of location and activity,
       anywhere in the world. GNA#17236
     * (Gtk) A bribe cost is now shown in the popup for units (for enemy
       units, this is estimated). GNA#17489

Tilesets / Art

     * The orientation of units is now tracked, so tilesets can provide
       different graphics for different unit orientations. GNAPATCH#2719
          + A tileset making use of this, Cimpletoon, is included. It is
            based on Amplio2 but has a full set of oriented unit sprites
            for the default ruleset. GNAPATCH#2739
          + Known issue in beta1: Cimpletoon did not have sprites for all
            Fundamentalist units (it lacked Elephants and Crusaders), so
            for rulesets with these units, it would use fallback sprites
            (Chariot and Knights respectively). As of beta2, the tileset
            is complete. GNA#19998

Gameplay / Rules

Changes affecting supplied rulesets

     * Nations:
          + The number of playable nations has increased from 387 to 541.
          + Out of these, a subset of 50 "core" nations has been defined,
            based mostly on nations that have appeared in the Civilization
            series of games. For localised versions of Freeciv, these
            nations are more likely to be translated than the remainder.
            Players are initially presented with the core set, and it will
            be used for random nation selection if no nations are
            specifically selected; but players can still select nations
            outside the core set, and if some do, then the full range of
            supplied nations will be used for random selection of
            remaining players. GNAPATCH#3449 GNAPATCH#3432
          + The civ1 and civ2 rulesets now have their own separate nation
            sets, more closely matching the original games. GNAPATCH#2243
     * The effect of veterancy on the cost of bribing a unit now depends
       on veteran bonuses, not numeric veteran level; bribe costs for
       veteran units have thus changed. GNA#19253
     * When the 'barbarians' server setting is disabled, huts no longer
       spawn barbarians.
     * When migration is enabled, citizens now consider the risk of plague
       when deciding whether to migrate. GNA#17740
     * In rulesets without tech upkeep enabled, if the bulb count goes
       negative (for instance due to 'conquercost'), technologies are no
       longer lost. This restores the behavior of previous versions of
       Freeciv. GNA#19487
     * Diplomats and Spies now have special names for their veteran
       levels, but behaviour is unchanged from 2.3. GNA#19850
     * In the default, multiplayer, and experimental rulesets, years are
       displayed with CE/BCE rather than BC/AD notation. GNA#15090
     * (as of beta2) The default map topology for new games has been
       changed to isometric, to match the default Amplio2 tileset.
       GNAPATCH#3764
     * (as of beta2) In the 'multiplayer' ruleset, the ability to build
       buoys has been removed, as they do not work well with national
       borders disabled (the default for this ruleset). It is expected
       that they'll be re-enabled in a future major release. GNAPATCH#3541
     * Changes to the 'experimental' ruleset:
          + Citizen nationality is enabled; see below.
          + Workers and Engineers can now gain veteran levels by working
            the land; this in turn allows them to work faster.
            GNAPATCH#2370 GNA#19818
          + A Mech. Inf. unit can now carry up to three Missile units.
            GNAPATCH#2481
          + Galleons can now carry Big Land units, and Frigates no longer
            can. Old savegames are handled gracefully. GNAPATCH#2643
          + Most technologies now have 'root_req' requirements. This means
            that it is not possible to acquire the technology by any means
            unless you already possess its 'root_req'.
            Currently-unreachable requirements are entirely hidden by
            default in the Gtk client, so when the game starts you can
            only see a few techs; you can see the rest with the 'Show all'
            button. GNAPATCH#2381

Changes and new features for rulesets/modpacks/scenarios

     * New feature: optionally, the nationality of citizens can be
       tracked. For instance, when you conquer a city, its citizens retain
       their original nationality. Currently this affects the cost of
       inciting cities and the chance of migration (if enabled); more
       effects are planned for future versions. GNAPATCH#2265
     * The veteran system has been reworked:
          + Per-unit veteran levels have been generalised; all veteran
            properties can now be set on a per-unit basis; previously, the
            chances of moving between levels could not. This means that
            different units can now usefully have different numbers of
            veteran levels for the first time. GNAPATCH#2346
          + Diplomatic combat and spy mission survival chances are now
            derived directly from the 'power_fact' property of the veteran
            level, rather than being based purely on the numeric veteran
            level. GNA#19850
          + As noted above, the effect of veterancy on unit bribe costs
            has changed.
          + The maximum number of veteran levels has doubled from 10 to
            20.
          + Units with only a single veteran level, or which can't become
            veteran, now do not have a veteran level displayed.
          + Information about veteran levels is now included in the
            on-line help. GNA#19851
     * Recursive transports are now supported (up to a depth of 5).
       GNAPATCH#2270
     * Two new tech_cost_styles: 3 with a new formula (early techs
       slightly easier, later techs much harder), and 4 which is similar
       to 2 (read from ruleset) but with the gaps filled with the new
       formula. GNAPATCH#2396
     * A new effect 'Irrig_Possible' and requirement range 'CAdjacent'
       (cardinally adjacent) have been added. The requirement for oceans
       or rivers for irrigation is thus no longer hardcoded and can be
       modified. GNAPATCH#2450
     * The 'CityTile' requirement now supports 'Adjacent' and 'CAdjacent'
       ranges, so effects can be triggered for tiles next to a city.
       GNA#18551
     * 'Surviving' requirements for wonders are now supported at Player
       range as well as at World range. GNA#17463
     * In ruleset definitions, specifying 'move_type' for a unit is now
       optional; if not specified it will be inferred from the native
       terrains/specials of the unit. GNA#13630 GNAPATCH#2991
     * A ruleset can now specify a 'default_government' for all its
       nations in nations.ruleset, rather than each nation being required
       to specify its initial government individually. GNAPATCH#3031
          + The supplied nations no longer include
            init_government="Despotism", so they can be used in rulesets
            which require a different initial government. GNAPATCH#3032
     * The image used for a city in the client is now set by the effects
       system (effect 'City_Image'), so it's no longer constrained to be a
       simple function of city size. GNA#17110
          + The experimental ruleset uses this to align city graphics with
            the city map radius.
     * Tile labels are supported. These are text labels that are displayed
       by all clients when they display a particular map tile. They can be
       added to scenarios in the editor. GNAPATCH#2408
     * The colors used for players, and for terrains on the minimap and
       map images, are now specified by the ruleset on the server side,
       rather than the tileset on the client side. GNAPATCH#2060
       GNAPATCH#2061
     * In rulesets with tech_leakage enabled, dead players are no longer
       taken into account in the calculation; so you cannot gain from
       their knowledge, but equally a dead, ignorant player no longer
       pushes up research costs. GNAPATCH#2956
     * The behavior where the senate of representative governments is
       bypassed has moved from the Any_Government to the No_Anarchy
       effect. GNA#19107
     * The 'min_dist_bw_cities' ruleset item has been retired; use the
       'citymindist' option instead. GNAPATCH#2537
     * Many changes to ruleset Lua scripting -- for full details see the
       Lua reference manual. These are all backward compatible.
       Highlights:
          + Script-triggered climate change (GNAPATCH#2624) and civil war
            (GNAPATCH#2627).
          + Scripts can now move existing units.
          + A script can test whether tiles have a particular base.
            GNAPATCH#2672
          + Script facilities for reading and manipulating unit
            orientation. GNAPATCH#2823 GNAPATCH#2836
          + Scripts can now read server settings. GNAPATCH#2955
     * (as of beta2) An internal 64kbyte limit on string length has been
       removed. Among other things, this allows longer Lua scripts in
       scenarios. GNA#20086

AI

     * (as of beta2) The city governor logic has been reworked, fixing
       various issues such as unexpected tax collectors in cities with
       many buildings, and a need to set minimal gold surplus to a lower
       target than expected. GNAPATCH#3620
     * (as of beta2) The AI's workers/settlers, and human players'
       autosettlers, will now automatically stop what they are doing and
       go elsewhere if threatened by an enemy unit and there is no
       defender on their tile. (Currently only threats from land units are
       considered.) GNAPATCH#3384
     * (as of beta2) Improvements to AI settler management:
          + The AI now considers worker units' food consumption (e.g.
            Settlers) to be less of a factor when deciding whether to
            build such units, to encourage it to do so. GNAPATCH#3693
          + Fix poor handling of rulesets containing boats which can only
            carry a single unit. Previously, the AI would generate
            settlers with the intention of sending them out on such boats,
            but then refuse to do so due to lack of room for a bodyguard,
            regardless of whether one was needed, often hurting expansion
            and leaving useless settlers. Now it only insists on room for
            a bodyguard if one is actually needed. GNA#19815
     * (as of beta2) Improvements to AI city defense:
          + Reduced the tendency of AI city defenders to be lured out of
            their city by nearby targets even in the presence of threats.
            GNA#20504
          + Cities in grave danger of invasion with no defending units
            were tending to build City Walls, uselessly. They will now
            prioritise acquiring a defender. GNA#20559
     * (as of beta2) Improvements to AI caravan management:
          + Caravans in transit are now taken into account when a city is
            deciding whether to build more caravans. Previously, a city
            could end up building endless caravans if existing ones did
            not complete their trade route. GNAPATCH#3529
     * The AI's management of its tax rates has been reworked to be more
       sophisticated; notably, it now takes tech upkeep into account. It
       also considers tech upkeep when determining the value of a tech.
       GNAPATCH#2251
     * AI planning for new cities has been improved slightly. GNA#19449
     * Autosettler planning for building railroads (GNAPATCH#2885,
       GNA#19560) and farmland (GNAPATCH#2889) has been improved. (Note
       that the latter is still only triggered by the existence of a
       Supermarket, so the AI still does not benefit, due to a
       chicken-and-egg situation.)
     * The extensive reworking of the AI code (see #Development), while
       not intended to introduce any functional changes (and extensively
       tested for this), may have changed behaviour in some rare cases.

Translations

     * New Indonesian translation.
     * (as of beta2) New Traditional Chinese translation.
     * Updated translations: Bulgarian, Catalan, Spanish, Scottish Gaelic,
       Korean, Polish, Dutch, Irish, and French.

Development

     * The AI code has been heavily refactored, with a view to making it
       easier for people to start their own projects to write better
       Freeciv AI.
          + There's now a concept of AI type; different players can have
            different AIs. The type can be specified to the server /create
            command and the Lua function edit.create_player().
          + The server can be built to accept dynamically loadable AI
            modules with the --enable-aimodules option to configure. A
            module is loaded by starting the server with the --LoadAI
            option.
          + Alternatively, a fixed set of modules can be compiled in with
            --enable-ai-static.
          + In addition to the 'classic' AI, the standard Freeciv package
            ships with the 'stub' and 'threaded' AIs. These are both dummy
            templates for development and do not work as shipped. They are
            enabled with the configure option
            --enable-aimodules=experimental.
          + See doc/README.packaging for some more information.

Build/portability

     * There is now a hard dependency on libcurl for HTTP access. This is
       used for metaserver communication and for freeciv-modpack.
       GNAPATCH#2320 GNAPATCH#2376
     * Efforts have been made to make the codebase compile without
       warnings with GCC 4.6 and (as of beta2) 4.7.
     * Use of some GNU make extensions has been removed from the build
       system, so it may now be possible to build with a POSIX 'make'.
       GNAPATCH#3378
     * freeciv-modpack can be built against either gtk2 or gtk3.
       GNAPATCH#2762
     * The configure option --enable-sys-lua allows use of a system-wide
       copy of Lua instead of the one shipped with Freeciv. GNAPATCH#2747

   See doc/README.packaging for more information.


MAJOR CHANGES FROM 2.2.x to 2.3.0
---------------------------------

   (from <http://www.freeciv.org/wiki/NEWS-2.3.0>)

   As well as many new features, many features from Longturn and some from
   Warclient have been merged into the main codebase for this release.

   A new program has been added to the Freeciv suite: 'freeciv-modpack'.
   This makes it easier to download and install add-ons ('modpacks':
   rulesets, tilesets, etc) to the right place; you can enter a URL,
   choose an add-on from the list, and the tool will install it to the
   correct place for this version of Freeciv to use it. Modpack authors
   should see this page for details of how to publish modpacks for
   installation by this program. GNAPATCH#1822

   As is usual for major releases, 2.3 clients cannot interoperate with
   pre-2.3 servers, and vice versa. Pre-2.3 savegames can however be
   loaded into 2.3, and in most cases, the supplied rulesets have not
   changed so much as to make it difficult to complete a game started with
   2.2.x's rules.

Server / General

Gameplay

     * Various limits have been lifted, including:
          + Maximum number of simultaneous players increased from 30 to
            126 GNAPATCH#1731
          + Map size
               o Maximum map size increased from 30,000 to 128,000 tiles;
                 maximum linear map dimensions increased from 254 to 512
                 GNAPATCH#1733
               o Minimum map size reduced to 16x16(!) GNA#17031
          + Allow goto paths that take more than 99 turns GNA#16792
     * There are now more ways of specifying the map size. Instead of
       specifying the size in thousands of tiles (via the 'size' option),
       you can specify the number of tiles per player ('tilesperplayer'),
       or the exact X and Y sizes ('xsize' and 'ysize'). The method is
       selected with the 'mapsize' option. GNAPATCH#1720
     * A number of new server settings have been added to customise
       gameplay:
          + 'killunhomed': units without a home city (such as starting
            units) can be configured to lose hitpoints each turn until
            they die. GNAPATCH#1501
          + 'unreachableprotects' controls whether 'unreachable' units
            (such as Bombers) protect the whole stack on their tile as in
            previous versions. If this is unset, a mixed stack is
            vulnerable to attack (including normally-unreachable units).
            GNAPATCH#1850
          + 'unitwaittime' allows a minimum time to be enforced between
            actions of a given unit on successive turns, to mitigate the
            'double-move problem'. GNAPATCH#1500
          + 'restrictinfra' allows enemy use of infrastructure such as
            roads and rails to be restricted. GNAPATCH#1266
          + 'airliftingstyle' allows airlifts between allied cities, and
            unlimited airlifts per turn. GNAPATCH#1189
          + 'techlost_recv'/'techlost_donor' allow introduction of a risk
            of technology loss when technologies are transferred between
            civilizations (via diplomacy, espionage, conquest etc).
            GNAPATCH#1263
          + 'trading_tech'/'trading_gold'/'trading_city' allow certain
            types of diplomatic agreements to be selectively disabled.
            GNAPATCH#1504, GNAPATCH#1506
          + 'globalwarming'/'nuclearwinter' allow these global
            catastrophes to be disabled. GNAPATCH#1505
          + 'team_pooled_research' allows pooled research to be disabled.
            GNAPATCH#1868
          + 'alliedvictory': all players in an alliance can share victory.
            This new behaviour is enabled by default. GNA#14278
     * (as of rc1) Changes to the 'timeout' setting now always have
       immediate effect, as in 2.0.x; previously, changes between non-zero
       values would not take effect until the next turn. GNA#18079
     * Improvements to observing:
          + The demographic report is now available to global observers.
            GNA#16486
          + Global observers can now view the city report (it shows cities
            from all nations). GNA#16699 GNAPATCH#2571
          + Global observers can now access the buildable target list in
            the city dialog. GNA#16487
     * The number of units built, killed, etc now contributes to the final
       score, and appears in the endgame report. GNAPATCH#1870
     * Changing a unit's activity is now more forgiving: if you
       accidentally stop an activity such as irrigation, but restart it
       without doing anything else, progress is no longer lost. GNA#15510

Clerical

     * Settings configuration on the client and server has been reworked.
       The most notable change is that enumerated and bitwise options are
       now set with strings instead of numbers (for instance, '/set
       barbarians hordes' instead of 4, '/set topology wrapx|wrapy'
       instead of 3). GNAPATCH#1301
     * The FREECIV_PATH environment variable can be overridden by three
       new variables: FREECIV_DATA_PATH, FREECIV_SAVE_PATH, and
       FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH. GNA#14624
     * Add-ons are now loaded from a sub-path ~/.freeciv/<version>/ (e.g.,
       ~/.freeciv/2.3/), since they tend to be specific to a version of
       Freeciv. GNA#14624
     * Servers send more information to the metaserver:
          + The 'timeout' and 'aifill' options (GNAPATCH#2092);
          + (as of beta2) the number of human players (as opposed to AIs)
            (GNAPATCH#2312); as of beta3 this is displayed in the client
            (GNAPATCH#2411)
     * New server command '/kick' and associated option 'kicktime' to lock
       out troublesome users. GNA#16933
     * New server commands '/ignore', '/unignore', and '/list ignored
       users', allowing players to suppress chat messages from specific
       users. GNAPATCH#1910
     * The '/create' command can now create a new player even in a running
       game. GNAPATCH#1574
     * New command '/lua' to execute a line of Lua script on the server
       command line. GNA#15644
     * More options have been added to the '/reset' command. GNAPATCH#1284
     * The name of the scorelog file is configurable with the new
       'scorefile' option. GNAPATCH#1750
     * The current ruleset can be shown by '/show rulesetdir' instead of
       '/rulesetdir' (this allows less privileged users to do so).
       GNA#16636
     * Observers can see the current votes in progress with the new
       command '/list votes'. GNA#16635
     * The server uses a new format for savegames. It can load savegames
       generated by old versions of Freeciv, but old versions will not be
       able to load new savegames. GNAPATCH#1541
          + Support has been added for future versions of Freeciv to save
            backward-compatible savegames (back to 2.3.0) via the
            'saveversion' server option.

Clients

     * Various report screens have been reworked so as not to redraw and
       lose their selections after a few seconds. GNA#16439
     * The total revenue from trade routes is now visible in the city
       report. GNA#16812
     * The chat log file name is now configurable. GNAPATCH#1749
     * (GTK) Some rework of the pregame connection screen and menus
       (GNA#16685). Buttons on this screen now adapt to selected
       player/user (GNA#15300).
     * (GTK) Tab completion of user and player names on the chatline.
       GNAPATCH#1867
     * (GTK) The goto/airlift dialog now shows which nation each city
       belongs to, and more detail on airlift capacity. GNA#15313
       GNAPATCH#2588
     * The research report is now updated when tax rates or city science
       output change. GNA#16776
     * (as of beta2) Improve handling of (non-default) rulesets which
       restrict reachability of technologies (via root_req in the ruleset)
       in the science report. You can now choose whether unreachable
       technologies are displayed. GNA#16852, GNA#16855, etc
     * (as of beta2) (Xaw) The Take Player command is implemented.
       GNAPATCH#2253
     * (as of rc1) In 2.2.x, the "Sell Obsolete" button in the Economy
       report could never be pressed. It has been renamed to "Sell
       Redundant", and now lets 'redundant' buildings be sold en masse
       (redundant buildings are those whose effects are entirely
       superseded by another, for which you may still be paying upkeep --
       for instance, Power Plants are redundant in cities with a
       Hydro/Nuclear/Solar Plants). In the Gtk client, the "Obsolete"
       column in the Economy report has been replaced with a "Redundant"
       column showing how many of each building in your empire are
       redundant. GNA#17937

Gameplay / Rules

Changes affecting supplied rulesets

     * Two new rulesets are included in the distribution:
          + multiplayer: a ruleset based on the default but tuned for
            multiplayer games, based on Madeline Book's "rewonder" ruleset
            for 2.1.
          + experimental: a ruleset showcasing new features of the Freeciv
            "engine", without strict regard for game balance and
            playability. It enables some of the new features mentioned
            below, such as variable city radii.
     * More than doubled the number of playable nations (from 187 to 387).
       Many improvements to existing nations, such as using native
       spellings for cities and leaders.
     * The interaction of promotions and diplomat-vs-diplomat contests has
       changed:
          + Attacking diplomats can now gain experience; previously, only
            defending diplomats gained experience. GNA#17265
          + The effect of veterancy on the outcome of these contests has
            been reduced; it can change the odds by at most 20%
            (previously, elite diplomats could become practically
            invincible). GNA#17264
     * The terrain effects of global warming and nuclear winter are now
       more severe: land can be lost to ocean (and vice versa), and
       glaciers can melt. GNA#17105
     * If migration occurs, citizens take half the food in the granary
       with them. GNAPATCH#1232
     * (as of rc1) In rulesets with Fundamentalism, it now has a happiness
       penalty for empire size (as it did in 2.0.x). GNA#18133
     * (as of rc2) The civ2 ruleset now uses a restricted set of 25
       nations, to better resemble the original game. Loading civ2
       savegames from older versions of Freeciv may cause nations to be
       reassigned; it will not be possible to load a civ2 savegame with
       more than 23 (non-barbarian) players. GNA#18419

New features for ruleset/modpack/scenario authors

   These features have been added to the Freeciv "engine", but aren't
   enabled in standard rulesets (except the experimental ruleset, in some
   cases).
     * Variable city radius: the circle of tiles able to be worked by a
       city is no longer fixed but can vary (radii from 1 to 5 possible)
       depending on requirements defined by the ruleset. GNAPATCH#1235
          + Accordingly, the maximum value for the 'citymindist' server
            option has been increased from 5 to 9. GNAPATCH#2262
     * Build slots: in ruleset-defined circumstances, cities with large
       production surpluses can now produce more than one of a given type
       of unit per turn. GNAPATCH#1234
     * Tech upkeep: rulesets can cause some research output to be diverted
       to maintaining expertise in existing technology rather than
       discovering new technology, with the risk of losing advances if the
       upkeep is not met (similar to gold upkeep for city improvements).
       GNAPATCH#1264
     * Rulesets can define units that can be converted into another type
       of unit on the player's command. GNA#13890
     * Rulesets can define "Capturable" units that can be captured by
       certain other "Capturer" units. (There is an associated server
       option 'homecaughtunits'.) GNAPATCH#1851
     * Rulesets can suggest or mandate server settings. GNA#13873,
       GNAPATCH#1200
     * A start position in a scenario can now be restricted to a set of
       nations rather than a single nation. The built-in editor now
       supports editing this set. GNA#13803
     * Various improvements to Lua scripting. See Events Reference Manual
       for some more detail.

Tilesets / Art

     * New default tileset with redrawn terrain graphics: "Amplio 2". The
       original Amplio tileset is available for 2.3 as an add-on (it can
       be found with the freeciv-modpack utility). GNAPATCH#1777
     * Larger versions of flags and shields are now included in the
       Freeciv distribution for use by larger tilesets; they are used in
       Amplio2 (as of beta4). GNAPATCH#2202

Translations

     * (as of rc2) New Scottish Gaelic localization (complete).
     * (as of beta3) New Irish Gaelic localization (not yet complete:
       55%).
     * Updated translations:
          + Complete translations: Polish, French, Spanish, Catalan, and
            British English.
          + Incomplete translations: Danish (95.8%), Finnish (85%),
            Ukrainian (81%), Italian (74%), Japanese (70%), Brazilian
            Portuguese (70%), Russian (69%), Swedish (60%), Lithuanian
            (43%), and Simplified Chinese (40%).

KNOWN ISSUES

     * There are some regressions in the SDL client relative to 2.2.x:
          + The city dialog has not been redesigned to accommodate the
            larger city map required by variable city radius support. As a
            result, the city map display is scaled down and difficult to
            read. GNA#15804
          + Not all setting types can now be modified; bitwise and color
            settings are not yet supported. GNAPATCH#1631 GNAPATCH#1957

                 transformed)
               o Lake (as Ocean but no Whales special; inland water below
                 a certain size is generated as Lake)
          + Triremes are not restricted to tiles next to land, but to
            (shallow) Ocean tiles; they now cannot even attempt to enter
            unsafe tiles
          + Triremes no longer get the +1 movement bonus from Nuclear
            Power that other sea units get
          + Triremes and Carriers can no longer attack land units
          + Submarine attack strength reduced from 15 to 12 (to make it
            easier to defend against them with escorts)
          + New base type buoy, which can be built by Engineers on water
            tiles with the Radio advance, and gives vision.
          + Ruins (left behind by destroyed cities, no effect on gameplay
            currently)
          + New advance Environmentalism and Solar Plant improvement,
            which can eliminate pollution from production
          + Trade route value now depends on size of cities, not on trade
            generated in them
          + New national borders system
          + Coastal Defense now available earlier (requires Gunpowder
            instead of Metallurgy)
          + No restrictions on specialists in small cities
          + Terrain within working range of a city can no longer remain
            unknown
          + Units in fortresses now regain 25% HP per turn (as in 2.0.x)
            instead of 100%
          + New nations

     * AI difficulty level: Cheating
     * New server options:

          + foggedborders: visibility of borders is subject to fog of war
          + borders gains new modes where player can see all tiles inside
            borders, and borders extend to unknown tiles revealing them
          + endspaceship controls whether spaceship reaching Alpha Cen
            ends the game
          + trademindist controls the minimum distance for trade routes
            between your cities
          + Times now specified in turns instead of years (endyear becomes
            endturn, onsetbarbs expressed in turns)
          + simultaneousphases renamed to phasemode and gains new options

     * Client interface changes:

          + Menus and shortcut keys revamped; notable changes include:

                 Ctrl+Shift+R/L/I to Shift+R/L/I
               o City Report: F1 to F4
               o Go/Airlift to City: Shift+L to T
               o Wake up Others (Shift+W) becomes Unsentry all on tile
                 (Shift+S)
               o Orders menu split into Select, Unit, Work, and Combat;

   and cities expand more borders with city size growth.
 - New diplomacy rules. Neutral state replaced with Armistice. You
   now start in War state, and cannot cross borders with military
   units except in War or Alliance states.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.14.2
 - Research cost has doubled, effects of science buildings doubled. SETI
   now improves Research Labs instead of giving free Research Labs to every
   city. Isaac Newton's College now improves all the player's universities.
 - New units: AWACS and Workers.
 - New option: national borders.  Units inside your borders do not cause
   unhappiness under Republic and Democracy.
 - It is no longer possible for one player to be in alliance with a player
   who is at war with another player you are allied with.
 - The Civ2 ruleset now has waste.  Default ruleset does not.
 - Incite costs changed, now cities closer to capital, with units and with
   buildings have much higher incite cost.
 - Killing a defending diplomat now costs you 1 movement point.
 - Units now have multiple, configurable veteran levels.
 - Team mates now pool their research. You may opt out and research
   individually by cancelling the 'Team' treaty.

   Elvish, Galician, Hobbits, Indonesian, Kampuchean, Malaysian, Martian,
   Nigerian, Quebecois, Sumerian, Taiwanese, Austrian, Belgian, Phoenician
   and Mexican.
 - New wonder: The Eiffel Tower. Makes AIs love you and improves reputation.
 - The building requirements of several buildings have been changed.
 - The whale special is reduced to 2 food, 1 shield and 2 trade.
 - Settlers / Workers / Engineers can never get veterancy.
 - Trireme's high sea loss now considers veterancy level (green 50%,
   veteran 25%, hardened 5%, elite 0%) before being divided by 2 if you
   have Seafaring or 4 when you reach Navigation (previously only fixed
   at 50% before being divided).
 - Glacier terrain is now unsafe for land units (15% chance per turn of
   being lost). Also doesn't count as coastline for Trireme safety or Fish
   and Whale generation. Roads/railroads can be built but all units (worker
   too) get 15% chance per turn of being lost any way!
 - King Richard's Crusade is now made obsolete by Robotics (previously
   Industrialization).
 - Fixed tech costs based on the number of prerequisites of the tech
   in the tech tree.
 - Nations have preferred nations to fork off when civil war occurs.
 - AI is much improved, and does not use 'double-move' any more.
 - AI now conducts diplomacy with you (and against you).
 - New difficulty level: Novice.  It severely handicaps the AI players.
 - Smarter autoexplorer and autosettler code.
 - Modpack options vastly improved: You can customize buildings,
   add buildings as requirements to units, restrict technologies to certain
   nations, have split technology trees, gold upkeep for units, new units
   and terrain flags and lots of other options.  (This is still done by
   editing configuration files with a text editor.)
 - Fewer popups (eg choose the new government from the menu directly)
 - Alternative map topologies, e.g., real support for isometric and
   hexagonal maps and "donut" map wrapping.
 - Incomplete support for drawing civ3 graphics.  See the civ3gfx tileset.
 - Global observer can observe the entire game.
 - New method of settings map dimensions: Just use 'size'.
 - Modified map generators.
 - Initial units can be selected with a server option.
 - 'Home' key centers on your capital.
 - Drag and drop goto.
 - Player authentication with optional passwords.
 - You can start the server and set server options from the client.
 - You can meet with other players for 20 turns after your units have last
   met, and you can exchange embassies when meeting.
 - You can bind the server to a given IP on multihomed hosts.
 - New client dialog which uses multicast to find servers on your LAN.
 - Compress network traffic and send only a delta (diff) of the data.
 - GTK2 client can now run in fullscreen mode.
 - GTK2 is now the default client (the code base also features fully
   functional GTK1, Xaw and native Win32 clients).
 - Convert charsets as they are sent between client and server.  All data
   files are now in UTF-8.
 - New (and incompatible) metaserver.
 - New ALSA sound plugin.
 - The s(entry) command no longer doubles as a means to put units on
   boats - use the new l(oad) command instead. 
 - Many more (smaller) changes, and massive changes under the hood.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.13.0
 - Unique city names, you no longer can name your cities the same,
   and you can enforce unique city names globally (optional).
 - A new map generator (generator 5) which creates pretty fractal
   maps.
 - You can load savegames from the server prompt.
 - You can save client commandline defaults.
 - Specialists are taken from content citizens first, instead of from
   unhappy citizens first. This makes it more difficult to quell unrest
   using taxmen and scientists.

 - While planning a goto (after hitting "g") a line will be displayed
   showing the route from the selected unit to the mouse pointer.

   an enemy unit the paradropping unit is lost. If you drop into terrain
   you thought was land, but which has changed to water, the unit is
   also lost.
 - diplomats/spies can't take action from a ship.
 - Refueling air units at turn update will refuel units with only 1 fuel
   first. Secundary criteria is unit cost.
 - Trireme loss percentage depends upon known technologies.
 - Leonardo's workshop will upgrade a random unit each turn, and not
   just the next one.

 - Lots of bug fixes, code cleanups, and help-text improvements.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.8.1:

 - Internationalization added.  Some aspects still need improvement,
   and in particular currently only works well if client and server
   both use the same language.  Initial (partial) translations
   included are: de es fr hu pl pt pt_BR.
 - Improvements to "trident" tileset, and this set is now the default.
 - New ruleset support for NATIONS, and many new nations added --

 - From Civ2, added Paratroopers unit and Airbase infrastructure.
 - Initial window size of Gtk+ client is smaller, to fit better on
   smaller screens, and can now resize detached chat/output window.

   production of a given item to some other item (both clients); can
   select multiple cities and issue commands (Gtk+ client only); can
   sort by different columns (Gtk+ client only).  Can also select
   multiple items in the Trade Report (Gtk+ client only).
 - In Civ2 style, can select which infrastructure item to pillage, and
   multiple units can pillage together.  Can now pillage fortresses,
   as well as new farmland and airbase infrastructure items.
 - More fields added to Demographics Report, and now configurable from
   a server option.
 - Added more information to "Active Units Report", and renamed to
   "Military Report".

   always clearly visible; improvements to refresh method for pixmaps
   in Gtk+ client; various other improvements to both clients.
 - Autosettlers no longer convert Plains/Grasslands to Forests, but
   will now Transform terrain.
 - AI can build spaceships, although does not do so very aggressively
   or intelligently yet.
 - Server and client may specify a different metaserver to use.  There
   is now a metaserver running on www.freeciv.org, and that is now the

   modpacks to give modified help to correspond to modified items.
 - Format of ruleset files is changed, no longer compatible with
   those for 1.8.0 and 1.8.1.
 - Removed science bonus of +1 per city per turn.
 - In Civ2 mode, overflight of a hut causes it to disappear, and can't
   build cities next to each other.
 - Rapture_size now 3, to conform to Civ2.
 - Settlers and Engineers now cost shield upkeep as well as food
   upkeep (depending on government type) as in both Civ1 and Civ2.
 - Helicopters do not lose hitpoints when over an airbase.
 - The amount of food required for a city grow is now ((citysize+1) *
   foodbox), instead of (citysize * foodbox); new behavior matches
   both Civ1 and Civ2.
 - Some re-organization of data directory, in adding data/scenario,
   and graphics now in data/trident, data/engels and data/misc.
 - Preliminary support for compiling the server on Mac (but networking
   code not yet ported).

 - Lots of bug fixes, code cleanups, and help-text improvements.

WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE 1.8.0:

 - The biggest change is a new client which uses the popular Gtk+
   toolkit.  The old Xaw client is still included as well.
 - A new alternate (30x30) tileset: the "trident" tileset.
   Start the client with "--tiles trident" to try it out.
   (This replaces the "classic/brunus" tileset, which is still
   available separately from the Freeciv ftp site.)
 - In the Gtk+ client, parts of the main window can be detached.
   Detaching them all allows a full-screen map window!
 - The data directory can now be specified as a "path" ($FREECIV_PATH),
   instead of a single directory.  By default, ~/.freeciv is now in
   the path, so if you download new tiles, modpacks, etc, you can now
   simply put them in ~/.freeciv
 - Server console improvements: can abbreviate server command names,
   and server option names.  Better prompt handling - eg, server no
   longer prints an unnecessary prompt each turn.

 - Space race!  Be the first player to build a space ship and colonize
   Alpha Centauri.
 - Civil war!  Capturing the enemy capital may split his empire.  Half
   of his towns will join a new AI leader!
 - Two tile sets in this release! The "big" ones are from Ralph Engels.
   I hope you will enjoy them.  The second set is an enhancement of the
   classic ones.  The server option -tiles allows to choose a subdirectory
   of the data directory to use different tiles.  (The data directory can
   be set with the DATADIR environment variable.)  Also, diagonal roads
   and railroads are now drawn.  Changed some of the national flags
   (especially changed Soviet flag to the Russian flag for Russians).
 - Rulesets can be used to customise units, advances, wonders, and
   improvements without recompiling -- see README.rulesets.

   building a settler, and options for units on auto-attack mode in the
   city.

 - The AI now builds diplomats to defend against enemy diplomats.
 - Settlers and engineers can do teamwork.  With enough manpower, all
   terrain improvements can be done fast!
 - With engineers, the terrain type can be changed using the new Transform
   command ('O').  For example, hills can be turned into plains.
 - Units only regenerate hit points if they have not moved at all for a
   full turn.
 - Gamelog option.  The whole history of a game can be stored in the
   gamelog file.
 - One can select a unit with 0 moves left from the main map.
 - City workers can be adjusted from the main map, with shift+button1.
 - Changed the order of libraries to fix problems on IRIX and Cygwin.
 - Changed the client-server protocol to use network byte order.

 - Clearer Yes/No toggle buttons in various places in the client.
 - Reduced color usage (but looks almost identical), so the client should
   now work fine on systems with 8 bit color displays.
 - Ability to use "scenarios", that is, pre-designed maps.  Scenarios
   for Earth and Europe games are included in the data directory.
   (Use them with the server command-line option -f, like savegames.)
 - More city names, so you're less likely to see "City 41" etc.
 - Saving large games is now much faster, and the savefile is smaller.
 - Improvements to the documentation and online help system, including
   a new help section on the "Zones of Control" game concept.
 - Detect repeated log messages and print repeat counts.
 - New server options randseed and aqueductloss.
 - Many other enhancements and bug fixes.

   Also, they can modified by clicking on the rate status icons.
 - The behaviour of spies and diplomats has been greatly improved.
 - Freeciv now needs to transmit a lot less data (<25%!) when playing
   over the Internet.  This will greatly speed up games.

   when used in conjunction with the GNU tools.
 - From now on, it will be possible for different Freeciv versions to
   talk to each other if they're able.
 - Tracy Reed (who provides www.freeciv.org) reports that our site is
   getting over 6,000 hits per month.  He was quoted as saying "Cool!
   Now my computer is doing something!"
 - Lots, and Lots, and Lots of donated patches. Thanks guys, keep 'em
   coming!
