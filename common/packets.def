/*

Syntax:

 Comments:
 =========

  Supported are: c-style (/ * * /), c++-style (//) and python style
  (#). Empty lines will be ignored.

 Typedef lines:
 ==============
 
  Start with "type" and have the format "type <alias> = <src>". You
  can now use <alias> at every place a type is expected. Nested type
  defs are possible.

 Packets:
 ========

  A packet definition starts with a header line, contains variable
  field declarations, and ends with a single line containing the word
  "end".
   
   PACKET_<PACKET_NAME>=<packet num>; [<packet flags>]
     <type1> <field1>; [<field flags>]
     <type2> <field2>; [<field flags>]
     ...
   end

   Header line:
   ------------

    The header line contains the packet name. The packet name is used
    for the naming of the generated code struct and functions:
      struct packet_*;
      send_packet_*
      dsend_packet_*
      dlsend_packet_*
      lsend_packet_*
      receive_packet_*
      handle_packet_*

    The header line also contains the packet number. The packet number
    is used as a numeric identification of a packet between the client
    and server. The packet number shall never change for an existing
    packet without the adding of a mandatory capability. Packets which
    are used for the capability checking PACKET_PROCESSING_STARTED,
    PACKET_PROCESSING_FINISHED, PACKET_SERVER_JOIN_REQ and
    PACKET_SERVER_JOIN_REPLY are excluded here. These packets should
    never change their number. The packet number can be freely choosen
    as long as it is below 255 and unique.

   Packet flags:
   -------------

    Packet flags is a comma seperated list of:

     is-info: a second packet with the same content can be discarded

     pre-send:
     post-recv: 
     post-send: generate calls to pre-send, post-receive and post-send
     hooks. These hooks are named: pre_send_packet_*,
     post_receive_packet_* and post_send_packet_*. The user has to
     provide these. These functions may be used to do extra
     preparations, conversions or checks.

     no-delta: don't use the delta protocol. This is useful for
     packets which contain always different data
     (packet_generic_integer) or are only sent once
     (packet_req_join_game). Sadly this also disables the use of 0 as
     the default value.

     no-packet: don't generate a packet argument for the send
     function. Currently only used by packet_generic_empty.

     no-handle: don't generate handle_* prototypes. The generated
     switch statements (server/srv_main_gen.c, client/civclient_gen.c)
     doesn't include code for this packet. You have to handle this by
     yourself. This may be required for special packets which are
     handled early in the sequence.

     handle-via-packet: force the packet type of the handle
     function. Otherwise the fields are passed to the handle function.

     handle-per-conn: normally the first parameter of the handle
     function is the player. handle-per-conn changes this to the
     connection the packet came from.

     add-cap: only transfer this field if the given capability is
     available at runtime. If you have a capability named
     "new_version" a field line may look like this:
       COORD x; add-cap(new_version)

     remove-cap: don't transfer this field if the given capability is
     available at runtime.

     dsend: request the creation of a dsend_packet_* function.  This is
     similar to a send function but instead of taking a packet struct
     as a parameter, it takes the fields of the packet as parameters.

     lsend: request the creation of a lsend_packet_* function.  This
     function sends to list of connections instead of just one 
     connection, which is the case for the other send functions.

     cs: a packet which is sent from the client to the server

     sc: a packet which is sent from the server to the client

  Each other packet line has the format "<type> <fields>;<flags>".

    Type:
    ----

      <type> is an alias or a basic type. A basic type has the format
      "<dataio-type>(<public-type>)". Exception here is the float
      type. You can specify with the dataio-type "float<number>" the
      transmission of a float in a uint32 multiplied by this factor.

    Fields:
    -------

      Comma seperated list of names. Each name can have zero, one or
      two array declarations. So "x", "x[10]" and "x[20][10]" is
      possible. The array size in the "[]" can be specified plain as a
      term. In this case all elements will be transmitted. If this is
      not-desired you can specify the amount of elements to be
      transfered by given the number. So the extenmded format is
      "[<full-array-size>:<elements-to-transfer>]". elements-to-transfer
      is relative to the packet.

   Field flags:
   ------------

      key: create multiple entries in the cache indexed by the key set
      (set of all fields which have the key attribute). This allow a
      better delta compression.

      diff: use the array-diff feature. This will reduce the amount of
      traffic for large arrays in which only a few elements change.
