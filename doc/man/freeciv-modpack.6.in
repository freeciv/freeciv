[ \-h|\-\-help ] \
[ \-i|\-\-install \fIURL\fP ] \

.SH DESCRIPTION
Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each player
becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal:
To become the greatest civilization.

Players of Civilization II\*R by Microprose\*R should feel at home, since one
aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules.

Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is
easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there!

This is the custom content installer program - see also
.IR freeciv-server (6)
.IR freeciv-client (6)
\&.

This program allows users to select and download add-on content
("modpacks") for Freeciv from the Internet, either from a list
maintained by the Freeciv team, or by using a URL obtained by other
means. It takes care of installing the files in the correct place
under the user's home directory for this version of Freeciv; it does
not install anything for system-wide use.

.B freeciv-mp-cli
is a version of the modpack installer usable from command line. By default
it lists modpacks from the default list or from list specified with
\fI\-\-List\fP. One can then run it again by giving appropriate
URL from the list for \fI\-\-install\fP parameter.

This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details
regarding the operation of
.B freeciv-mp-XXX
see README.modpack_installer in the Freeciv distribution, and the
documentation at
.UR @HOMEPAGE_URL@
the Freeciv website

.
.SH OPTIONS

.BI "\-d \fIlevel\fP, \-\-debug \fIlevel\fP"

Acceptable values for the \fIlevel\fP are:

\fBfatal\fP     for fatal messages only.

\fBerror\fP     for fatal and error messages.

\fBwarning\fP   for fatal, error and warning messages

\fBnormal\fP    for fatal, error, warning and normal messages (default).

\fBverbose\fP   for fatal, error, warning, normal, and verbose messages.

.TP
.BI "\-h, \-\-help"
Prints a short summary of the command line options.
.TP
.BI "\-i \fIURL\fP, \-\-install \fIURL\fP"
Automatically install modpack from a given URL.
.TP
.BI "\-L \fIURL\fP, \-\-List \fIURL\fP"
Gets modpack list from given URL, rather than the standard location on the
Freeciv team's servers.
.TP

Installs modpacks under given directory hierarchy.
.TP
.BI "\-v, \-\-version"

.SH FILES
.B freeciv modpack installer
installs files to the following subdirectories of the user's home directory
(or another directory specified with \fI\-\-prefix\fP), as appropriate:

\(bu
.I .freeciv/scenarios/

\(bu
.I .freeciv/@DATASUBDIR@/

The modpack installer maintains a record of installed modpack names and
versions in these files:

\(bu
.I .freeciv/scenarios/.control/mp.db

\(bu
.I .freeciv/@DATASUBDIR@/.control/mp.db

This information is used for display, and for deciding whether any new
modpacks' dependencies are already satisfied. It is not used by the
other Freeciv programs, and can fairly safely be removed if it gets out
of sync with the actual state of installed modpacks. These are sqlite
files whose format is subject to change.

.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B freeciv modpack installer
accepts these environment variables:
.TP
.BI HOME
Specifies the user's home directory.
.TP
.BI http_proxy
Set this variable accordingly when using a proxy.
.TP
\fBLANG\fP  or  \fBLANGUAGE\fP
Sets the language and locale on some platforms.
.TP
\fBLC_ALL\fP  or  \fBLC_CTYPE\fP
Similar to LANG (see documentation for your system).
.TP
.BI USER
Specifies the username of the current user.
