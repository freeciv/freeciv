.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfreeciv-ruleup\fR updates rulesets compatible with previous
.IR freeciv-server(6)
version to ones compatible with current version. It does that
simply by loading and saving the ruleset. It can load ruleset
in the format of previous freeciv version, and it saves in
the format of current freeciv version. Because it's meant
to load rulesets that are not meant to be used with current
version of freeciv, one usually wants to set FREECIV_DATA_PATH
environment variable to point to datadir of the old freeciv
version before using it. By default it saves updated ruleset
to directory named after ruleset name with prefix ".ruleup"
added.

.SH BUGS
Need to setup FREECIV_DATA_PATH to point to old freeciv
version datadir makes using the tool somewhat cumbersome.
