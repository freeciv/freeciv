.SH DESCRIPTION
Freeciv is a free turn-based multiplayer strategy game, in which each player
becomes the leader of a civilization, fighting to obtain the ultimate goal:
To become the greatest civilization.

Players of Civilization II\*R by Microprose\*R should feel at home, since one
aim of Freeciv is to have compatible rules.

Freeciv is maintained by an international team of coders and enthusiasts, and is
easily one of the most fun and addictive network games out there!

This is the client program used to connect to a Freeciv server - See also
.IR freeciv-server (6)

This manual page only lists the command line arguments. For details
regarding the options when using
.B freeciv-gtk2
.B freeciv-sdl
.B freeciv-xaw
.B freeciv-win32
or
.B freeciv-ftwl
see the Client Manual which can be found at
.UR
http://www.freeciv.org/
.UE
as well as the documentation which is part of the Freeciv distribution.
.SH OPTIONS
All the Freeciv clients accept of the standard X Toolkit command line
options along with the additional options listed below. Those may not
be combined; that is, "\-np caesar 5557" will not work, instead you
 would need to enter "\-n caesar \-p 5557". All options have a short
form (single hyphen and single letter) and a long form (double hyphen
and a complete word); their effects are identical.
.TP
.BI "\-A, \-\-announce \fIprotocol\fP"
Uses \fIprotocol\fP when searching game from LAN.
Possible values for \fIprotocol\fP are:

\fBIPv4\fP

\fBIPv6\fP

\fBnone\fP
.TP
.BI "\-a, \-\-autoconnect"
Skips the connect dialog, automatically inserting the default values. This is
quite convenient when all has been set up properly.
.TP
.BI "\-d \fIlevel_number\fP, \-\-debug \fIlevel_number\fP"
Sets the amount of debugging information to be logged in the file named by the
.I \-l
option. Acceptable values for the \fIlevel_number\fP are:

\fB0\fP    for fatal messages only.

\fB1\fP    for fatal and error messages.

\fB2\fP    for fatal, error and normal messages.

\fB3\fP    for fatal, error, normal, and verbose messages.

.TP
.BI "\-F [ \fIsignal_number\fP ], \-\-Fatal [ \fIsignal_number\fP ]"
Raise a custom signal on failed assertion.  If \fIsignal_number\fP is not
specified, then the ABRT signal will be used.
.TP
.BI "\-h, \-\-help"
Prints a short summary of the command line options.
.TP
.BI "\-l \fIfilename\fP, \-\-log \fIfilename\fP"
Defines a log file, \fIfilename\fP, to be produced during processing. Use the
.I \-d
option to set how much is logged.  By default, fatal and normal messages are 
printed to standard output.  With a log file, such messages go to the log
instead.
.TP
.BI "\-M \fIURL\fP, \-\-Meta \fIURL\fP"
Specifies the \fIURL\fP of the metaserver to connect to. A metaserver is a
place where Freeciv servers can publish their presence. Freeciv clients consult
the metaserver to offer users a selection of games to join. By default the 
standard Freeciv metaserver is used. 
.TP
.BI "\-n \fIstring\fP, \-\-name \fIstring\fP"
Specifies the name (\fIstring\fP) to play under. This option is critical when 
reconnecting to a game. Please note that you might need to quote your playername.

.TP
.BI "\-r \fIfilename\fP, \-\-read \fIfilename\fP"
Specifies a file, \fIfilename\fP, of server commands which the server will 
automatically read and process, as if you had typed them in at the server's 
prompt. (for spawned server only)
.TP
.BI "\-s \fIaddress\fP, \-\-server \fIaddress\fP"
Specifies the game server \fIaddress\fP to connect to. This server might easily
run on the same machine as the client.

Specifies the \fIfilename\fP to read the sound tags from.
.TP
.BI "\-t \fIstring\fP, \-\-tiles \fIstring\fP"

included with this distribution.

.I amplio2.tilespec

\(bu
.I hex2t.tilespec

\(bu
.I isophex.tilespec

\(bu
.I isotrident.tilespec

\(bu
.I trident.tilespec
.SH ENVIRONMENT
The Freeciv client accepts these environment variables:
.TP
.BI FREECIV_CAPS
A string containing a list of "capabilities" provided by the server. The
compiled-in default should be correct for most purposes, but if you are familiar
with the capability facility in the source you may use it to enforce some
constraints between clients and server.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_COMPRESSION_LEVEL
Sets the compression level for network traffic.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_DATA_ENCODING
Sets the data encoding (used for data files, savegames, and network strings).

.TP
.BI FREECIV_PATH
A colon separated list of directories pointing to the
.B freeciv
directory. By default freeciv looks in the following directories,
in order, for any data files: the current directory; the "data" subdirectory
of the current directory; the subdirectories ".freeciv" and ".freeciv/2.3"
in the user's home directory; and the directory where the files are placed
by running "make install".  This setting has no effect if
\fBFREECIV_DATA_PATH\fP, \fBFREECIV_SAVE_PATH\fP and
\fBFREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH\fP are defined together.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH
A colon separated list of directories pointing to the
.B freeciv
data directories. By default freeciv looks in the following directories,
in order, for any data files: the current directory; the "data" subdirectory
of the current directory; the subdirectory ".freeciv/2.3" in the user's
home directory; and the directory where the files are placed by running
"make install".  If not set,
.BI FREECIV_PATH
is used instead.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_SAVE_PATH
A colon separated list of directories pointing to the
.B freeciv
save directories. By default freeciv looks in the following directories,
in order, for any data files: the current directory; and the subdirectory
".freeciv/saves" in the user's home directory.  If not set,
.BI FREECIV_PATH
is used instead, looking also in "saves" potential subdirectories.
.TP
.BI FREECIV_SCENARIO_PATH
A colon separated list of directories pointing to the
.B freeciv
data directories. By default freeciv looks in the following directories,
in order, for any data files: the current directory; the "data/scenario"
subdirectory of the current directory; the subdirectory ".freeciv/scenarios"
in the user's home directory; and the directory where the files are placed
by running "make install".  If not set,
.BI FREECIV_PATH
