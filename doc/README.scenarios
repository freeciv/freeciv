Creating Freeciv scenarios
==========================

Overview:
---------
Freeciv scenario -files are essentially savegames with specific game
situation. The savegame format allows some things that are useful only
when the savegame in question is a scenario. There's a [scenario] section
with some parameters applicable to scenario saves only, and possibility
to include some lua script for scripting the scenario.
The deciding difference between regular savegames and scenario savegames
is that latter have is_scenario set to TRUE in [scenario] section.
Freeciv saves current game situation as a scenario file, with the full
[scenario] section, when one saves by the /scensave server command or
uses "Save Scenario" from the client Edit -menu.


[scenario] section:
-------------------
Savegame [scenario] section can have following fields

- is_scenario
  Always TRUE in a scenario savegame

- name
  Name of the scenario

- authors
  Text listing authors of the scenario

- description
  Description of the scenario

- save_random
  Whether random number state is saved to the scenario

- players
  Whether player information is saved to the scenario, or is it map-only
  scenario

- startpos_nations
  Whether nations should use start positions defined in the scenario map

- prevent new cities
  Is founding new cities prevented in the scenario, locking it to cities
  present on the map

- lake_flooding
  Should ocean tiles connecting to a lake tile flood the lake tile

- handmade
  Set to TRUE when savegame file is manually edited. This has no gameplay
  effect, but it indicates that scenario might have some properties that
  are not yet supported in the editor. When editing such a scenario in the
  editor, warning is shown that some properties might get lost

- allow_ai_type_fallback
  Is it ok to fallback to another player AI type if one defined in the
  scenario file is not available when scenario is loaded

- ruleset_locked
  Is the scenario locked to one specific ruleset. Default is TRUE

- ruleset_caps
  When scenario is not ruleset_locked, this capability string defines
  required capabilities of compatible rulesets

- datafile
  Luadata to load. See chapter 'Luadata' for details


Luadata:
--------
Some rulesets have a lua script that can parse special luadata file
to adjust their behavior. Such luadata file can be provided by the
ruleset itself, or by the scenario using the ruleset. This is controlled
by 'datafile' field in the scenario savegames [scenario] section.
- If the field is omitted, ruleset's own luadata is used, if present
- If field has value 'None' (case insensitive), luadata is not used
  at all, as if it was not present even in the ruleset
- Any other value of datafile is considered prefix part of a filename
  of form <prefix>.luadata to use as the luadata file. The file must
  be found from the freeciv's savegame path, usually from the same
  directory where the scenario savegame itself is.
