Cygwin installation notes
=========================

This is doc/INSTALL.Cygwin, which contains Cygwin platform specific
Freeciv installation information.

A translated version of this file may be in language specific
subdirectories of doc/.

See also the generic installation notes in INSTALL.

Cygwin is a free Unix variant for MS Windows operating systems.
It comes with an X server, Xorg.

To install Freeciv for Cygwin:

a) Install or update your Cygwin by downloading and running installer
   from http://www.cygwin.com/

   In addition to default install, install at least following packages
   to build freeciv
   (packages to be installed as dependencies of ones in the list
    are not listed):
   - gcc-g++ (section Development)
   - pkg-config (Development)
   - make (Development)
   - libsqlite3-devel (Devel)
   - libiconv-devel (Libs)
   - libcurl-devel (Libs)
   - zlib-devel (Libs)
   - libicu-devel (Libs)

  Install development packages for the guis you want to compile, one or more of
  - libgtk3-devel (Libs)
  - libQt5Core-devel (Libs) + libQt5Gui-devel (Libs)

  For additional functionality install also:
   - libreadline-devel (Libs) (for server command history & completion)
   - gettext-devel (Development) (for native language support)
   - libSDL2_mixer-devel (Libs) (for client audio support)

  To get and build freeciv development version directly from version control,
  you need also
   - git (Development)
   - automake1.15 (Development)
   - libtool (Development)

  To run freeciv client, you need to install also
  - xlaunch (X11)
  - fontconfig (X11)

b) Get a Freeciv source tree (the doc/ directory this INSTALL.Cygwin is in,
   is a subdirectory of the source tree's root directory).
   Put it in a temporary place like /tmp.

      ./configure --enable-client=<gui> [any other options e.g. --prefix=...]
   where <gui> is "gtk3.22", "qt", or list like "gtk3.22,qt". If you
   didn't install gettext-devel, you have to give also configure option
   --disable-nls to disable Native Language Support. If you're building
   Qt-client, you also need option "MOCCMD=/usr/bin/moc-qt5"

   If you are building directly from version control, and not from
   tarball that has some files, including ./configure, pregenerated,
   you need to run ./autogen.sh instead of ./configure. Use same options
   as you would for directly running ./configure.

   If you get messages of missing or outdated components, install them.

c) Compile and install Freeciv:

      make
      make install

You should now have bin/freeciv-server.exe and bin/freeciv-<gui>.exe in the
directory you installed Freeciv into (/usr/local by default).
If 'make install' succeeds, the source code tree can be removed.

d) Test the results:

    /path/to/freeciv-server.exe  [any additional options]

  will start the server, but you only need it for private games.
  To start the client, you need to run the X server (this can be
  done by typing 'xlaunch'), then into a terminal type

    /path/to/freeciv-<gui>.exe  [any additional options]

More details on using server and client are in doc/README.
