BUGS

Freeciv 1.14.0 is a "stable" release and is considered bug-free enough
for everyday use.  However if you do find a bug, we would really like to
know, so that we can fix it.  This file lists known bugs in this release,
and gives information about reporting new bugs.

This lists only the most obvious bugs.  For a complete list, see:

    http://gna.org/bugs/?group=freeciv

KNOWN BUGS:
===========

 - In the Xaw client, the -t options for the tileset to use sometimes
   does not work. In this case, use --tiles instead.

 - The display of units in the field left below the turn done button
   is a little bit buggy. The AI can move units without an update of
   the field. So you see 3-4 units on the field on the left side but
   only 1 is there. See issue PR#2625 for more info.

 - Your CMA settings are only sent to the server when you press
   turn done, and therefore changes you make to CMA in the same
   turn as you save a game will be lost.

 - If you use the CMA the resulting savegame isn't endian and 64 bit
   safe. So you can't use the savegame on a computer with a different
   architecture.

 - The easy AI is not easy enough for novice players.  If the AI is
   beating you up early in the game, try setting the "generator" server
   option to 2 or 3.  That is, in the server, before starting a game,
   type:  set generator 2
   or:    set generator 3

 - The hard AI is not hard enough for very experienced players, and
   still does some stupid things.  E.g., it prefers leaving cities in
   revolt rather than letting them starve/shrink.

 - Sometimes there may be too many advances in the "goal" menu of
   the science report, such that the menu goes off the bottom of the
   screen and you cannot select some items. This affects the GTK+-1.2
   client only.

 - You may sometimes get the messages
	{ss} player for sample <01> not found
	{ss} player for sample <01> not found
   when using the esound sound driver. This is nothing to worry about.

 - If you hit ctrl-c in the client while using the esd sound plugin,
   the currently looping sound may not be properly aborted.

 - Some effects of wonders and research first take effect the turn
   after. Fx when building the lighthouse some triremes will only get
   the movement bonus the next turn.

 - The Xaw client can only display 25 citizens in the city dialog.

 - The autoattack generally doesn't work very well.

 - When planning a goto in the server, fx for an autosettler or an
   airplane, the server will use knowledge not available to the player.

 - The science dialog is not updated when you gain a tech. You need to
   close and open it.

 - In the GTK+ client, sometimes the area near the minimap contains
   garbage.

 - Automate routines like auto explore don't handle triremes very well.

 - LOG_DEBUG doesn't work with non-GCC compilers.

 - When setting server variables, the server in many cases doesn't
   check the values as well as it could.

 - Bad things happen when you manipulate multiple global worklists
   simultaneously.

 - Even in singleplayer the AI will get a chance to move both before
   and after the human player each turn. This will sometimes give the
   impression that the AI moves twice.

 - The Xaw client does not work well with the KDE window manager.
   Try using the GTK+ client or another window manager.

 - All options given to the client will also be passed to the UI. This means
   when there are identical options they will conflict. It is a problem for
   the -d and sometimes -t options using the Xaw client. One workaround is
   to use long versions of the options instead (--debug and --tiles, in this
   case). See PR#1752.

REPORTING A BUG:
================

(If it is a bug in a translation, it should be mailed to the Primary
Contact for the language.  See <http://freeciv.org/wiki/Translations> for
the names and addresses of these people.)

Here's what to do:

 - Check that it is not one of the known bugs listed above!  :-)

 - Check the Freeciv website, to ensure you're playing the latest
   version.  (We may have already fixed the problem.)

   In particular, you might like to try a development snapshot,
   from our CVS repository.  You can FTP them from:

        http://download.gna.org/freeciv/latest/

 - Check the Freeciv FAQ on the Freeciv website to see if we've
   published a way to work around your bug.

 - Check the Freeciv Bug Tracking System at:

        http://gna.org/bugs/?group=freeciv

   to see if the bug has already been reported.

 - Submit a bug report!

   If you want to send the Freeciv developers some comments
   but don't want to lodge a bug report, you can sent email to
   <freeciv-dev@gna.org>, the Freeciv developer's mailing list.

   What to include in your bug report:

   - Describe the problem, including any messages that were displayed.

   - Indicate which client(s) you are using (GTK+ or Xaw).

   - Tell us the name and version of:

       - The Operating System you're using.  You may find the
         "uname -a" command useful.

       - The version number of Freeciv.

       - If you are using the GTK+ client, the version numbers
         (if you know them) of your GTK+, GLib, and imlib libraries.

       - If you are using the Xaw client, the version numbers (if you
         know them) of the X libraries, the Xpm library, and the Xaw
         library, and particularly whether it is standard Xaw, or a
         variant such as Xaw3d, Xaw95, or Nextaw.

       - If you're compiling from source code, the name
         and version number of the compiler.

       - If you're installing from a binary package, the name of
         the package, the distribution it's for, and where you
         got it from.

   - If Freeciv "dumps core", then we may ask you to use a debugger to
   give us a "stack trace".  You'll need the "core" file for this, so
   please hold onto it for a while.
