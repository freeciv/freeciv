==============================
Installing Freeciv with Meson:
==============================

This file describes how to compile and install Freeciv with the experimental
Meson build system support. Meson support is still work-in-progress. Fully
supported official way to compile and install Freeciv is still using
autotools as described in INSTALL.


Prerequisites:
==============

Freeciv has mostly the same prerequisites no matter if it's built
with autotools or meson and ninja. The only difference is the requirement
of the build system itself. Meson build does not need autotools, nor does
autotools build need meson. See main (autotools) INSTALL file for the
common prerequisites.

For the meson based build minimum version of meson is 0.44.0.


Overview:
=========

There's two parts in building freeciv. First one needs to configure the
build, and then execute it.

Build directory is configured with the 'meson' command. This is equivalent
of running './configure' in autotools based system. Meson does not allow
configuring the source directory. It always requires separate build directory.
Just create an empty directory, cd in to it, and run meson with path to
source directory as parameter. You can also give configure options in this
phase.

> mkdir build ; cd build
> meson ../freeciv-3.1.0

You need to configure the build directory just once. As source files get
updated, you can just execute incremental builds in the build directory.
You can have multiple build directories configured to use the same source
directory, typically set up with different configure options. You can
for example have separate build directories for different kinds of clients.

The build is executed with 'ninja' command. This is equivalent of running
'make' in autotools based system. It's also used to install freeciv

> ninja
> ninja install


Configure options:
==================

Configure options are given as '-D<option>=<value>'.
For example to set freeciv installation prefix as
'/home/cazfi/freeciv-install':

> meson ../src -Dprefix=/home/cazfi/freeciv-install

You can give configure options when you first set up the build directory
(like in example above), or you can change configure options for the
build directory later by 'meson configure' subcommand like this:

> meson configure -Dprefix=/home/cazfi/freeciv-install

You get full list of configure options by running 'meson configure'
subcommand without any configure options to set

> meson configure

Some of the configure options are implemented by meson itself for
all meson-based projects. Some options are implemented in freeciv build
system, and they are specific to freeciv.


Notable generic configure options:
----------------------------------

prefix (string):
  The directory where Freeciv will be installed. You can install multiple
  versions of Freeciv in parallel by using different prefix for each.
  It's also a good idea to use prefix to avoid messing your system directories

debug (boolean):
  Whether debug version of Freeciv should be built. While this is generic
  option, some functionality in Freeciv depends on this setting.


Freeciv specific configure options:
-----------------------------------

ack_experimental (boolean):
  As the official build system for freeciv is still autotools, user
  has to acknowledge that they are using experimental build system when
  using meson. This configure options must be set to 'true', or build
  refuses to start

clients (array):
  List of clients to build. To disable client build completely, give an
  empty array ('-Dclients=[]'). Currently only gtk3.22-client build is
  supported ('-Dclients=gtk3.22'). By default builds gtk3.22-client

fcmp (array):
  List of freeciv modpack installer UIs to build. To disable their build
  completely, give an empty array ('-Dfcmp=[]'). Currently gtk3, and cli
  are supported ('-Dfcmp=gtk3'). By default builds just gtk3 UI.
