  improve its effectiveness. For improvements that the city can not yet build

  the effects for the building.

  A few base variables:
    c - number of cities we have in current range
    u - units we have of currently affected type
    v - the want for the improvement we are considering

  This function contains a whole lot of WAGs. We ignore cond_* for now,
