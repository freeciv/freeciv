 General
 -------

 Ruleset with high granularity values. This makes it possible to have
more fine grained ruleset effects without integer math peculiarities
messing with them.

 You can consider all the outputs and costs to be 100x as valuable
as in more standard rulesets.
 Each movement point is divided to 6 fragments, so granularity of
movement costs is 1/6 points.


 Rules
 -----

 * Extras are built by placing them, not by units.
 * City center tiles get +25 trade until city size 8, +100 after
 * For cities to work oceanic tiles, Fishing must be known
 * Cities are protected a bit from rapid shrinking due to
   continuous famine by the fact that when city shrinks,
   its granary is set to 10% full, not empty
 * Initially there's a 50% penalty to collecting taxes. This is
   removed by the Counting tech.
 * In cities units heal 10% of their maximum hitpoints each turn,
   outside cities none. Techs and buildings improve this.
 * Fortifying is not possible before Trenches technology is known.
 * Base city radius, both for workable area and vision,
   extends one tile away from the center.
 * Units with zero defense value can be captured by any military unit
 * In the beginning cities can grow up to size 3.
 * Units cannot be upgraded before Engineering is known
 * Reseach bulbs are for specific tech. If you switch research, accumulated
   progress stays with the previous tech target.
