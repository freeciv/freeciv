; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or

; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.

; Note that the freeciv AI may not cope well with anything more
; than minor changes.

; Below: The individual government types, one per section.
;
; The actual tag used (the * in [government_*]) does not matter, except
; it must be unique within this file, and it may be used in debug
; output when reading this file.
;
; For the "official" rulesets, the order of these sections should not
; be changed because that would break backward compatability with
; savegames.  (In particular, if Fundamentalism is added to default
; ruleset, should be added at end.)
;
; Notes on fields:
;
; name         = translatable name as seen by user
; rule_name    = (optional) internal name for savegames, rulesets etc; if
;                not present, "name" is used for this purpose too. Since
;                the name used in savegames must not change, if you want
;                to rename an item after a ruleset has been released, you
;                should set "rule_name" to the original value of "name".

; ai_better    = AI will not consider this government for use if the
;                government listed here is available
; ruler_male_title   = The default male ruler title for the government type.
;                      It's a format string where name of the ruler is marked
;                      by '%s'.
;                      Individual nations may override this by their
;                      own title.
; ruler_female_title = The default female ruler title for the government type.
;                      See above ruler_male_title.
; helptext     = optional help text string; should escape all raw newlines
;                so that xgettext parsing works
