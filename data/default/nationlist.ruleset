; Descriptions of nation sets
; These are self-contained subsets of the available nations; one of these
; can be chosen in pregame with the "nationset" option. No nations
; outside the selected subset will be used.
; The first set defined is the one that is used by default. It is mandatory
; to have at least one, but if there is only one, it will be kept out of
; the user`s way.
; name          = Translatable name of the set presented in the UI.
; rule_name     = Unique persistent name; this is also visible to users as
;                 the value of the "nationset" server option, and presented
;                 in "/list nationsets". It should thus be short, in lower
;                 case, and not contain spaces or punctuation.
;                 The same saved "nationset" setting may be used for multiple
;                 rulesets, so if your custom ruleset has any set which
;                 contains all of its nations, it is useful to give it a
;                 rule_name of "all" so that users can specify that they
;                 always want the choice of all available nations by
;                 default.
; description   = Optional short user description of this set.

; do not have some of them (if a referenced game identifier is not on these
; lists, it will cause an error, to allow typos to be spotted)

; Nations can specify terrain types and river for "natural" city names.
