;
; A specialist is a city citizen who is not a tile worker. Usually the
; player can control what specialist each citizen is, so long as the
; requirements for that specialist are met.
;
; Below are the entries for the specialists, one per specialist type.
; The tag name (in [specialist_*]) doesn't matter so long as it's unique.
; For each specialist the following fields may be set:
;
;
; name          = translatable (plural) name as seen by user
; rule_name     = (optional) internal name for savegames, rulesets etc; if
;                 not present, "name" is used for this purpose too. Since
;                 the name used in savegames must not change, if you want
;                 to rename an item after a ruleset has been released, you
;                 should set "rule_name" to the original value of "name".
; short_name    = one-character "short name" used (for instance) in cityrep;
;                 should be first character/abbreviation of "name"
; graphic       = tag specifying preferred graphic
;                 Different images based on citizen number are supported.
;                 If no such images indexed with citizen number are found,
;                 plain tag is used instead.
; graphic_alt   = fallback graphic tag in case the specialist graphic isn't
;                 found.
; reqs          = requirements to have the specialist pick (see
;                 effects.ruleset and README.effects for help on requirements)
; helptext      = optional help text string; should escape all raw newlines
;                 so that xgettext parsing works
;
