; The GameLoss unit requirement makes sending units on a suicide mission to
; capture and destroy cities deep inside enemy terrain national suicide.
; The risk of moving a GameLoss unit to the target city increases the cost
; of the action. Rationalization for the requirement: the physical presence
; of the Leader makes it easier to comply with the order to destroy the
; city. (See the "orders by phone" Milgram experiment variation)
;
; The domestic city requirement forces the player to invade a city before
; they can destroy it. If this limit is weakened by allowing the
; destruction of undefended (MaxUnitsOnTile) foreign cities during war it
; will lead to situations where a player can destroy a city but is unable
; to occupy it.
; Rationalization: the resistance must be crushed before the destruction.
;
; TODO: create an international incident (set the Casus_Belli_Success
; effect value to 1000) if "Destroy City" still is overpowered.

; (Note that it is still possible to end up with farmland on such terrain

; Deserts with food bonuses _are_ allowed farmland (hence exceptions).
