; You should not modify this file except to make bugfixes or
; for other "maintenance".  If you want to make custom changes
; you should create a new datadir subdirectory and copy this file
; into that directory, and then modify that copy.  Then use the
; command "rulesetdir <mysubdir>" in the server to have freeciv
; use your new customized file.

; Note that the freeciv AI may not cope well with anything more
; than minor changes.

; output when reading this file.

; For the "official" rulesets, the order of these sections should not
; be changed because that would break backward compatability with

;                to rename an item after a ruleset has been released, you
