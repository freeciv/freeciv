                   Multiplayer Freeciv Ruleset
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The 'multiplayer' ruleset is intended to rectify some game balance
issues encountered on multiplayer servers with the classic ruleset.
It is based on the 'rewonder' ruleset designed by Madeline Book for
Freeciv 2.1.

This ruleset is also suited for LongTurn and Play-By-Email games.


1. Changes compared to the classic ruleset
   ---------------------------------------

The differences can be extracted by

#> diff -ur data/classic data/multiplayer

Gameplay
--------

Unit movement rates are twice that of the classic ruleset, to
make this ruleset usable for LongTurn games.

Trade routes are enabled.

The cost of inciting a city to change hands has been greatly
increased.

Units attacking with less than a full movement point get penalized because
of their tiredness. Only the fragment of their normal attack strength
equivalent to their movement point fragment is considered. If they have 2/3
movement points, they will attack with 2/3 strength. If they have 1/3 movement
points, they will attack with 1/3 strength.

Wonder changes
--------------

Almost all great wonders have been changed into small wonders; that
is, they are player-unique rather than world-unique. Each player may
build their own "Oracle", for example, or even move such small wonders
around by rebuilding them in other cities. For small wonders that
become obsolete, this happens only when the relevant technology is
discovered by the owning player (rather than by any player).

Unless otherwise noted, for these small wonders, all wonder effects
that affect all of a player's cities have been changed to affect only
cities on the same continent as the city with the small wonder.

The Palace is still the only Small Wonder that can be moved around
by rebuilding it to a new city. Other Small Wonders can be rebuilt
only if you have lost them with the city where they were.

For the Colossus, Copernicus' Observatory, Great Wall, Hoover Dam,
King Richard's Crusade, Oracle, Shakespeare's Theater, Statue of
Liberty, and Sun Tzu's War Academy, these are the only changes. Other
now-small wonders have been adjusted or completely changed:

- A.Smith's Trading Co.: Costs 300 (was 400).
- Eiffel Tower: You get one unit free of shield upkeep per city,
  instead of "AI love".
- Great Library: Reduces city corruption by 50%, instead of the
  tech-parasite effect. Costs 200 (was 300) and never obsoletes (used
  to be "Electricity").
- Hanging Gardens: Just makes two citizens happy in each city on the
  same continent. Costs 150 (was 200).
- J.S. Bach's Cathedral: Costs 300 (was 400).
- Leonardo's Workshop: Costs 300 (was 400). Upgrades two units per
  turn (was one).
- Lighthouse: No longer makes sea units veteran (justs add +1 movement).
- Magellan's Expedition: Instead of the +2 move rate, it just makes
  new sea units built on the same continent veteran.
- Michelangelo's Chapel: Costs 300 (was 400).
- Pyramids: Instead of giving the granary effect, it allows the city
  where it is built to rapture grow.
- Women's Suffrage: Costs 300 (was 600). Affects 2 and 4 citizens
  under republic and democracy respectively (was 1 and 2).

As for the remaining great wonders:

- Apollo Program: Does not reveal the map.
- Darwin's Voyage: Costs 400. Gives only one advance.
- Cure For Cancer: Costs 400 (was 600), and makes two citizens happy
  in every city owned by _any_ player who knows "Genetic Engineering".
- Manhattan Project: No change.
- United Nations: Instead of unit healing, gives the senate and
  anarchy-from-disorder effects of Democracy to all nations,
  regardless of government.

Building changes
----------------

- Colosseum: Renamed to "Amphitheater", and cost decreased to 60 (was 70).
- Supermarket: Increases farmland tile food output by 100% (was 50%).
- Police Station: Affects 2 and 4 unhappy citizens under Republic and
  Democracy respectively (was 1 and 2).

Government changes
------------------

The Fundamentalism government is added. This is similar to the one in
the civ2 ruleset, with following exceptions:
- Food upkeep for Settlers is 3
- Free unit upkeep is worth 10 shields in each city

Technology changes
------------------

- Philosophy gives a free tech only to the first player to research it.
- Discovery of Environmentalism additionally knocks 50% off cities'
  pollution from production.
- Added Fundamentalism from the civ2 ruleset.

Unit changes
------------
- Unit movement rates are twice the values in the classic ruleset.
- Caravans cost 30 production (was 50); Freight remain at 50.
- Elephants, Crusaders, and Fanatics added from the civ2 ruleset.

Default settings
----------------

The ruleset suggests some server setting changes, although these can
be overridden. Notably, huts, barbarians, national borders, and
diplomacy are all disabled, more initial units are given, and "fairer"
map settings are used.


2. Use the new ruleset
   -------------------

To play a game with the multiplayer rules, start the server with:
       ./fcser -r data/multiplayer.serv
or a single player game with
       ./freeciv-gtk3 -r data/multiplayer.serv
(and any other command-line arguments you normally use; depending on
how you have Freeciv installed you may have to give the installed
data directory path instead of "data")

Start the client normally.  The client must be network-compatible
(usually meaning the same or similar version) but otherwise nothing
special is needed.

Note that the Freeciv AI might not play as well with rules other
than standard Freeciv.  The AI is supposed to understand and
utilize all sane rules variations, so please report any AI
failures so that they can be fixed.
