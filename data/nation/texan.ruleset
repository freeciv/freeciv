 most populous state of the USA, famous for its \"larger than life\"\
 cowboy culture and Mexican heritage. After the famous Battle of the Alamo,\
 The Texians defeated the Mexicans at San Jacinto and declared independance.
 The Republic of Texas lasted from 1836 to 1846, after which it became the\
 28th state of the United States. Historically, Texas was ruled in full or in\
 part by six nations: France, Spain, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the\
 Confederacy, and the USA, as expressed in the slogan \"six flags over\ Texas\".")
